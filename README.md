# Car Price Prediction 🚗💰

This project predicts **car prices** using a **Random Forest Regressor**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict car prices based on features such as mileage, engine size, horsepower, and other specifications.

## 🛠️ Steps
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted categorical features into numerical
   - Cleaned the dataset

2. Model:
   - Used **Random Forest Regressor**

3. Evaluation:
   - Metrics used: R² Score, RMSE
